Hello! To make database for my program you should install SQL Server Management Studio.
After that, when you`ll connect your server - do next things:

1) Go to the SQL SMS and make things on the next screenshots:
  - create database using New Query.png
  - create table in MyAcc DataBase.png

2) Next part, you should go to VS and ... :
  - use server explorer in vs to connect database.png
  - add connection.png
  - add MyAcc database from our server .png
  - go to properties of our database.png
  - copy our connection string.png
  - type this in app.config.png

Thanks!
